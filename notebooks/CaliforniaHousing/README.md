# California Housing Dataset

Here we adapt an example taken from a [textbook](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml2/blob/master/02_end_to_end_machine_learning_project.ipynb) to provide 
an end-to-end use-case of Frequent Directions for Ridge Regression.
The directory is comprised of 5 notebooks which must be executed in order:

1. Problem setup
2. Data preprocessing and visualisation
3. Preparation for ML pipeline
4. Model selection using Sklearn and a guide on implementing a custom estimator class
5. Implementing the FDRR class and performance.
